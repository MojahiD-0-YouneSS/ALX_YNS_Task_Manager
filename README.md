task manager
**Personal Story**:
Growing up, I always found joy in organizing thingsâ€”whether it was my study schedule, household chores, or even planning events. 
This affinity for organization led me to pursue software engineering, where I could create tools that help others stay organized. 
The inspiration for YNS-Task-Management came from my own struggle to find a task management tool that suited my needs. By developing this 
application, I hope to provide a solution that helps others achieve their goals more efficiently.
